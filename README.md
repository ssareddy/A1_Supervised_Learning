Code Setup Instructions

1. Datasets that were used, if they do not show up when cloning repo use this link to copy the dataset
    a. Heart Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset
    b. Diabetes Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset

4. Next, do pip install -r requirements.txt
    a. This will install the python packages necessary for the code to run if they do not already exist

5. Run main.py, when running, the code will save all plots in the outputs folder
