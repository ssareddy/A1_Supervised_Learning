Code Setup Instructions

1. Datasets that were used, if they do not show up when cloning repo use this link to copy the dataset
    a. Heart Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset
    b. Diabetes Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset

2. Next, do pip install -r requirements.txt
    a. This will install the python packages necessary for the code to run if they do not already exist

3. Run project_code.py, when running, the code will create another directory called outputs
    a. In outputs, all plots will be generated and placed
